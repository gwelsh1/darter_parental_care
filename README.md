# darter_parental_care
This is a repository for scripts used by Gabrielle Welsh to process darter WGS data. Primary goals of the project were identifying areas of the genome under selection in darter lineages that gaimed parental care and under relaxed selection in lineages that lost that trait.

Step 1: Raw reads processed with CutAdapt and Trimmomatic.
files should end in _R1.fastq.gz and _R2.fastq.gz

Step 2: Reads were aligned to a Etheostoma cragini reference genome (downloaded from NCBI)
